The MariaDB SkySQL DBaaS API Terraform Provider allows database services in MariaDB SkySQL to be managed using Terraform.---

# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Provider

The MariaDB SkySQL DBaaS API Terraform Provider allows database services in MariaDB SkySQL to be managed using Terraform:

* It allows SkySQL services to be configured using Terraform's declarative language

* It automatically provisions new SkySQL services when the Terraform configuration is applied

* It automatically tears down SkySQL services when the Terraform configuration is destroyed

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open source infrastructure-as-code (IaC) utility.

The MariaDB SkySQL DBaaS API Terraform Provider is a Technical Preview. Software in Tech Preview should not be used for production workloads.

Alternatively, SkySQL services can be managed interactively using your web browser and the [SkySQL Portal](https://skysql.mariadb.com/dashboard).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

## Limitations

* The terraform resource `skysql_service` doesn't support updates. If you need to change the configuration of a service, you need to destroy the service and create a new one.

### Secrets and Terraform state

Some resources that can be created with this provider, like `skysql_credentials`, are
considered "secrets", and as such are marked by this provider as _sensitive_, so to
help practitioner to not accidentally leak their value in logs or other form of output.

It's important to remember that the values that constitute the "state" of those
resources will be stored in the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state) file.
This includes the "secrets", that will be part of the state file *unencrypted*.

Because of these limitations, **use of these resources for production deployments is _not_ recommended**.
Failing that, **protecting the content of the state file is strongly recommended**.

The more general advice is that it's better to generate "secrets" outside of Terraform,
and then distribute them securely to the system where Terraform will make use of them.
